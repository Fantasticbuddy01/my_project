        <h2>A TRUE LEADER</h2>
        <span>
            Hello friends here you are going to find some useful material for a better personality development.
        </span>
        <p>
            From childhood itself we have been listening about leaders and leadership qualities but have you ever wondered what actually 
            a <strong> Leader </strong> is and what are those <strong> Leadership Qualities</strong> that one should inherit in order to 
            be called a leader.The first question that should strike in our mind should be,  What thing separates a leader from a normal 
            person ? because no one is a born leader. The simple answer to this question is that a leader see that particular aspect which
            others can't. <strong> He do not do different things , he just do things differently.</strong>
        </p>
        <span>
            Another thing that separetes a leader from a normal human is the <STRONG>PERCEPTION</STRONG>.It's not the perception of others
            is wrong or inappropriate but the perception of a leader is more inclined towards logic and reality rather than heard rumours.The 
            most importantaspect of a leader's personality is that you would feel safe in his presence. one whom you could trust blindly without 
            knowing is a true leader. Now after reading this you would surely think what are those qualities which we can develop to become a leader.
            first of all i would ssay that itâ€™s not a one day thing or an overnight process. <STRONG> GREAT THINGD TAKE TIME</STRONG> is a famous
            quote which fits here perfectly. it's not like you read all the qualities and next day you say ,"whoo, i m a leader.",NO. Leadership need
            not reflect in your words. it should reflect in your actions and the day you realize that you don't need to prrove that you are a leader just
            because you know that your actons are already doing that , congratulations ypu are a LEADER.
